* Preprocessed 49 features into categories based on weight of evidence; built Probability Default model using Binomial Logistic Regression; measured model performance using ROC, Gini and Kolmogorov-Smirnov; 
* Created scorecard from model coefficients and assigned credit scores to debtors in test set; analyzed cutoffâ€™s impact on quality of debtors and loan approval rate;
* Built Loss given Default and Exposure at Default model using Logistic and Linear Regression;
* Estimated Expected Loss for each loan from PD, LGD, EAD predictions to get risk weights of assets, in order to meet the regulatory capital requirement in Basel;
